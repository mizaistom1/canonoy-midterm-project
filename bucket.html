                        One of my first achievements in life is that I graduated elementary school with honors.
                        Honestly, I did not even expect that I was going to receive one, I just kept on studying
                        and having fun while I was that young and I was not bothered by these academic achievements yet.
                        Maybe that is the key factor in receiving these achievements, just keep on studying without having
                        any expectations to avoid putting pressure in yourself from achieving these awards. Maybe doing 
                        that instead of always thinking about trying to get the awards is much better since you have nothing
                        at stake, less pressure and more feeling at ease while studying.

                        One of my biggest achievements while studying programming is that me and my group Successfully
                        developed a fully-functional application. A budget planner/calculator. This budget planner
                        helps users manage their financial struggles. In this application, users can either list down
                        their current savings as well as their needs and wants. This application shows how much the users
                        should spend in their savings account. This application also shows a visual representation of how much
                        the user has spent in a month or in a day. All the user has to do is input their spendings as well as their
                        earnings and the application will do the math for how much the user has spent or earned. My group and I 
                        have successfully defended this application with high remarks in Senior High School (SHS). The panels expressed
                        high praise for our application. Our group was also selected as one of the representatives of our SHS strand to
                        present our research to compete with other SHS strands. This is really one of my biggest achievements while studying
                        so far.

                        I've always been drawn to the logic and structure behind how applications work, which is why I am eager to become a
                        back-end developer. The idea of building the foundation that powers websites and applications excites me, as it requires
                        problem-solving, optimization, and efficiency. I love working with databases, APIs, and server-side logic to ensure that
                        applications run smoothly and securely. The thought of designing scalable systems that handle large amounts of data
                        fascinates me, and I enjoy tackling the challenges that come with making applications fast and reliable. Every time I
                        learn more about languages like Python, Java, or Node.js, I feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that I’m improving my
                        ability to build robust systems. Debugging and optimizing code gives me a thrill because every fix brings me closer to a
                        flawless system. I also enjoy collaborating with front-end developers to create seamless user experiences, ensuring that
                        everything on the surface runs smoothly because of the solid infrastructure behind it. The ever-evolving nature of
                        back-end development motivates me to keep learning and adapting to new technologies and best practices. I am excited
                        about the opportunity to work on real-world applications that make a difference in people's lives. Becoming a back-end
                        developer isn't just a career choice for me—it's a passion that I am determined to master.

                    This is one of the first things that came to my mind when I was young growing up in a middle class family.
                    I am not able to buy the things I want for myself, for my family, and for my loved ones. I don't wanna say 
                    the phrase "I don't have enough money" when I am with them. I wanna be the one to be able to provide.
                    I wanna be rich enough so that generations of my family would not have to worry about where to get their savings
                    or how much they wanna spend. I wanna be rich enough so that my parents will not have to work as hard as they
                    are doing right now. I wanna spoil my loved ones with the things they want in life that they could not have right now.
                    I wanna be rich not just for myself, more so for my family and loved ones. I never wanna see them struggling about
                    money anymore and I am so tired of seeing them like that. Being rich is not just a want for me, it is a need and I will
                    do anything I have to do in order to achieve this. Even if I don't like my job, I will keep working just to achieve this.
                    This is how much I wanna be rich.
