            <p>
                The Pyramids of Giza are one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and for good reason. These towering structures
                have stood the test of time, leaving historians, archaeologists, and engineers in awe of their construction. The fact
                that they were built around 2600 BC, at a time when no modern technology existed, makes their creation even more
                mind-blowing. There is no clear explanation as to how ancient Egyptians managed to move and position such massive
                limestone blocks with such precision. Was it pure human ingenuity, an advanced building technique lost to time, or
                something else entirely? The mystery surrounding the pyramids is what makes them so fascinating. Seeing them in pictures
                is incredible, but I want to stand before them, feel their immense presence, and witness firsthand the brilliance of one
                of humanity’s greatest achievements.

            <ul>
                <li>By Air: Cairo International Airport (CAI) is the main gateway, with flights from major cities worldwide. Other airports include Luxor (LXR), Hurghada (HRG), and Sharm El-Sheikh (SSH).</li>
                <li>By Train: Egypt has a railway network connecting major cities like Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor.</li>
                <li>By Cruise: Many travelers take a Nile River cruise between Luxor and Aswan to explore ancient temples.</li>
                <li>By Bus: Long-distance buses operate between cities, though they can be less comfortable than other options.</li>

            <h2>Other Places to Visit in Egypt</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Luxor & The Valley of the Kings</strong> – Often called the "world’s greatest open-air museum," Luxor is home to some of Egypt’s most impressive ancient sites. The
                Valley of the Kings is where many pharaohs, including Tutankhamun, were buried in elaborately decorated tombs. The
                nearby Karnak and Luxor Temples feature towering columns, giant statues, and intricate hieroglyphs that transport
                visitors back to the time of the pharaohs.</li>

                </center>

                <li><strong>Abu Simbel</strong> – These massive rock temples, built by Pharaoh Ramses II, are one of the most jaw-dropping sites in Egypt. Carved directly
                into the cliffs, the temples are famous for their four colossal statues of Ramses II sitting at the entrance. What’s
                even more impressive is that the entire site was relocated in the 1960s to prevent it from being submerged by the rising
                waters of the Aswan High Dam.</li>

                </center>

                <li><strong>Alexandria</strong> – A beautiful coastal city with a fascinating history, Alexandria was once home to the legendary Great Library of
                Alexandria, which was one of the most important centers of learning in the ancient world. Today, visitors can explore
                the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a modern tribute to the ancient library, as well as ancient ruins, such as the Catacombs of
                Kom El Shoqafa. With its Mediterranean coastline, Alexandria also offers a unique blend of Egyptian and Greek
                influences, making it a one-of-a-kind destination.</li>

                </center>

                <li><strong>Siwa Oasis</strong> – Hidden in Egypt’s Western Desert, Siwa Oasis is a remote paradise known for its crystal-clear salt lakes, ancient ruins,
                and natural hot springs. It’s the perfect place to experience a different side of Egypt, away from the busy tourist
                spots. Visitors can explore the Temple of the Oracle, where Alexander the Great is said to have received a divine
                prophecy, or simply relax in the peaceful desert landscape.</li>
