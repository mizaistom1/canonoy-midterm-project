            <h2>Why this place is special to me</h2>
            <p>
                I first came across Stonehenge while scrolling through my Facebook news feed, 
                and from that moment, it has never ceased to amaze me. The sight of those massive, 
                ancient stones standing in a perfect formation sparked endless questions in my mind. 
                How were they placed like that? Who arranged them, and for what purpose? At first, I 
                wanted answers. I wanted to understand the history, the mystery, and the science behind 
                it. But over time, I realized that knowing the facts wasn’t enough—I wanted to experience it for myself.
                <br><br>
                Now, my curiosity is no longer about finding explanations. I just want to stand before Stonehenge, 
                to see its grandeur with my own eyes, to feel the atmosphere of something so ancient and mysterious. 
                Pictures and videos can only capture so much, but I believe nothing compares to the awe of witnessing 
                it in real life.

                <li><strong>The Tower of London</strong> –  A historic fortress that has stood for nearly a thousand years, 
                the Tower of London is one of the most famous landmarks in England. It has served as a royal palace, a prison, and even a
